SNAKES - THE GAME
=================

WELCOME TO SNAKES!

Prepare to enter a fast-paced world where reflexes matter, apples are pixelated, and the snake is... very, very hungry.

## OBJECTIVE:

Eat as many red apples as you can to grow your snake and increase your score.
Avoid crashing into the walls or your own body — unless you enjoy watching explosions.

## HOW TO PLAY:

▶ Arrow Keys = Move the snake
▶ M = Toggle background music (On/Off)

## SCORING:

🍎 Each apple gives you +10 points
💀 One crash and it’s GAME OVER
💾 Your highest score is automatically saved in "High Score.txt"
